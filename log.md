# created respository
# started on basic proposal docuent with emphasis on methodology 
# specifically looking into licor and assay specifics

### 6/11/2025
#found some papers on both in vivo and in vitro methods
#now I just need to make sense of it all
#In vivo with licor might be the best way, should be able to do it via only fluoresence measurements
#need to measure where ETC is limiting

### 6/18/2025
# meeting with nick
# gonan try to do a/ci curve as well as lrc
# a/ci, then lrc w/ fluoresence, then raise temperature
# growth temperatures: 20/15 & 35/30
# leaf temperatures: 5
# light and dark measurements
# Getting protocol writen down!!!
# species: something easy..? cotton..?
# replicates: 20-40... 10-20 of each?
# keep well watered and fertilized
# par= 1200?? vary during day
# grow for 1/1.5 months

### 6/23/2025
# started protocol
#   # Controls
#      # growth temperatures: 20/15 & 35/30 C
#      # species: Gossypium
#      # replicates: 20-40... 10-20 of each?
#      # keep well watered and fertilized
#      # co2 :420 ppm
#      # par= 1200, vary during day
#      # grow for 1/1.5 months
#      # measurement temperatures: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 c
#   # Protocol
#      # Dark adapt plants
#      # Set licor to temperature, let stabilize
#      # use light settings found in Johnson paper
#      # Measure minimum (Fo) and maximum (Fm) fluorescence to get (Fv/Fm)
#      # Add in smallest level of light, calculate (F)
#      # increasing light in steps of 100 umol/m2/s, calculate (Fs), (F'm), and (F'o)
#      # Run A/ci curve (see Evan's paper) at maximum light value
#      ### RUN ACI CURVE AT LIGHT Level WHICH CAUSED LEF TO STOP (VMAX) TO 
#          SEE IF ITS THE SAME WHEN THE INCREASE IN CO2 MAKES IT JMAX LIMITED AGAIN
#      # raise to next temp value, repeat

### 6/27/25
# Protocol with Dr. Smith Suggestions:
#   # Controls
#      # growth temperatures: 25/15 & 35/25C
#      # species: Gossypium
#      # replicates: 20-40... 10-20 of each?
#      # keep well watered and fertilized
#      # co2 :420 ppm
#      # par= Peak 1200, increase/decrease throughout day
#      # grow for 1/1.5 months
#      # measurement temperatures: 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 c
#   # Protocol
#       # Dark Response curve 
#         # Dark adapt plants
#         # Set licor to temperature, let stabilize
#         # use flash settings found in Johnson paper
#         # Measure minimum (Fo) and maximum (Fm) fluorescence to get (Fv/Fm)
#         # Measure gas exchange Point
#         # Repeat for all Temperature values
#       # Light Response Curve
#         #  **NOTE** may have to switch leaves
#         # use actinic light settings found in Johnson paper
#         # Set licor to temperature, let stabilize
#         # start at 100 PAR, calculate (F)
#         # increasing light in steps of 100 umol/m2/s, calculate (Fs), (F'm), and (F'o)
#         # Run A/ci curve (see Evan's paper) at maximum light value (because this is when cytb6f is no longer limiting)
#         # Repeat for all Temperature values
#      # In vitro
#         # Take consistant lead sample
#         # Store at -80
